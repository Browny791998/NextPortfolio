    detailedDescription: "This system is designed for users, such as caregivers, to upload the health status of a patient. The caregiver can also provide personal details about themselves. Doctors then use the information to diagnose the primary health issue of the patient based on the updates provided.I worked as a key team member on a patient care system, utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. The system comprised a customer-facing website built with WordPress, PHP, and MySQL, and a dashboard for doctors developed with Angular on the frontend and Python on the backend, hosted on Google Cloud. While I primarily focused on developing the doctor dashboard, I also gained exposure to technologies like the NDB library for database management, OpenAI for API generation, and basic BigQuery syntax. Although I didn’t directly work on the deep learning and machine learning components, I made efforts to understand their application within the project.",
